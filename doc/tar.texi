@section What @code{tar} Does

The @code{tar} program is used to create and manipulate @code{tar}
archives.  An @dfn{archive} is a single file which contains within it
the contents of many files.  In addition, the archive identifies the
names of the files, their owner, and so forth.

You can use @code{tar} archives in many ways.  Initially, @code{tar}
archives were used to store files conveniently on magnetic tape.  The
name @samp{tar} comes from this use; it stands for Tape ARchiver.
Often, @code{tar} archives are used to store related files for
convenient file transfer over a network.  For example, the GNU Project
distributes its software bundled into @code{tar} archives, so that all
the files relating to a particular program (or set of related programs)
can be transferred as a single unit.

The files inside an archive are called @dfn{members}.  Within this
manual, we use the term @dfn{file} to refer only to files accessible in
the normal ways (by @code{ls}, @code{cat}, and so forth), and the term
@dfn{members} to refer only to the members of an archive.  Similarly, a
@dfn{file name} is the name of a file, as it resides in the filesystem,
and a @dfn{member name} is the name of an archive member within the
archive.

The @code{tar} program provides the ability to create @code{tar}
archives, as well as for various other kinds of manipulation.  The term
@dfn{extraction} is used to refer to the process of copying an archive
member into a file in the filesystem.  One might speak of extracting a
single member.  Extracting all the members of an archive is often called
extracting the archive.  Often the term @dfn{unpack} is used to refer to
the extraction of many or all the members of an archive.

Conventionally, @code{tar} archives are given names ending with
@samp{.tar}.  This is not necessary for @code{tar} to operate properly,
but this manual follows the convention in order to get the reader used
to seeing it.

Occasionally archive members are referred to as files.  For people
familiar with the operation of @code{tar}, this causes no difficulty.
However, this manual consistently uses the terminology above in
referring to files and archive members, to make it easier to learn how
to use @code{tar}.

@section How to Create Archives

To create a new archive, use @samp{tar --create}.  You should generally
use the @samp{--file} option to specify the name the tar archive will
have.  Then specify the names of the files you wish to place in the new
archive.  For example, to place the files @file{apple}, @file{angst},
and @file{asparagus} into an archive named @file{afiles.tar}, use the
following command:

@example
tar --create --file=afiles.tar apple angst asparagus
@end example

The order of the arguments is not important.  You could also say:

@example
tar apple --create angst --file=afiles.tar asparagus
@end example

This order is harder to understand however.  In this manual, we will
list the arguments in a reasonable order to make the commands easier to
understand, but you can type them in any order you wish.

If you don't specify the names of any files to put in the archive, then
tar will create an empty archive.  So, the following command will create
an archive with nothing in it:

@example
tar --create --file=empty-archive.tar
@end example

Whenever you use @samp{tar --create}, @code{tar} will erase the current
contents of the file named by @samp{--file} if it exists.  To add files
to an existing archive, you need to use a different option.
@xref{Adding to Archives} for information on how to do this.

When @samp{tar --create} creates an archive, the member names of the
members of the archive are exactly the same as the file names as you
typed them in the @code{tar} command.  So, the member names of
@file{afiles} (as created by the first example above) are @file{apple},
@file{angst}, and @file{asparagus}.  However, suppose an archive were
created with this command:

@example
tar --create --file=bfiles.tar ./balloons baboon ./bodacious
@end example

Then, the three files @file{balloons}, @file{baboon}, and
@file{bodacious} would get placed in the archive (because @file{./} is a
synonym for the current directory), but their member names would be
@file{./balloons}, @file{baboon}, and @file{./bodacious}.

If you want to see the progress of tar as it writes files into the
archive, you can use the @samp{--verbose} option.

If one of the files named to @samp{tar --create} is a directory, then
the operation of tar is more complicated.  @xref{Tar and Directories},
the last section of this tutorial, for more information.

If you don't specify the @samp{--file} option, then @code{tar} will use
a default.  Usually this default is some physical tape drive attached to
your machine.  If there is no tape drive attached, or the default is not
meaningful, then tar will print an error message.  This error message
might look roughly like one of the following:

@example
tar: can't open /dev/rmt8 : No such device or address
tar: can't open /dev/rsmt0 : I/O error
@end example

If you get an error like this, mentioning a file you didn't specify
(@file{/dev/rmt8} or @file{/dev/rsmt0} in the examples above), then @code{tar}
is using a default value for @samp{--file}.  You should generally specify a
@samp{--file} argument whenever you use @code{tar}, rather than relying
on a default.

@section How to List Archives

Use @samp{tar --list} to print the names of members stored in an
archive.  Use a @samp{--file} option just as with @samp{tar --create} to
specify the name of the archive.  For example, the archive
@file{afiles.tar} created in the last section could be examined with the
command @samp{tar --list --file=afiles.tar}.  The output of tar would
then be:

@example
apple
angst
asparagus
@end example

The archive @file{bfiles.tar} would list as follows:

@example
./baloons
baboon
./bodacious
@end example

(Of course, @samp{tar --list --file=empty-archive.tar} would produce no
output.)

If you use the @samp{--verbose} option with @samp{tar --list}, then tar
will print out a listing reminiscent of @samp{ls -l}, showing owner,
file size, and so forth.

You can also specify member names when using @samp{tar --list}.  In this
case, tar will only list the names of members you identify.  For
example, @samp{tar --list --file=afiles.tar apple} would only print
@samp{apple}.  It is essential when specifying member names to tar that
you give the exact member names.  For example, @samp{tar --list
--file=bfiles baloons} would produce no output, because there is no
member named @file{baloons}, only one named @file{./baloons}.  While the
file names @file{baloons} and @file{./baloons} name the same file,
member names are compared using a simplistic name comparison, in which
an exact match is necessary.

@section How to Extract Members from an Archive

In order to extract members from an archive, use @samp{tar --extract}.
Specify the name of the archive with @samp{--file}.  To extract specific
archive members, give their member names as arguments.  It essential to
give their exact member name, as printed by @samp{tar --list}.  This
will create a copy of the archive member, with a file name the same as
its name in the archive.

Keeping the example of the two archives created at the beginning of this
tutorial, @samp{tar --extract --file=afiles.tar apple} would create a
file @file{apple} in the current directory with the contents of the
archive member @file{apple}.  It would remove any file named
@file{apple} already present in the directory, but it would not change
the archive in any way.

Remember that specifying the exact member name is important.  @samp{tar
--extract --file=bfiles.tar baloons} will fail, because there is no
member named @file{baloons}.  To extract the member named
@file{./baloons} you would need to specify @samp{tar --extract
--file=bfiles.tar ./baloons}.  To find the exact member names of the
members of an archive, use @samp{tar --list} (@pxref{Listing
Archives}).

If you do not list any archive member names, then @samp{tar --extract}
will extract all the members of the archive.

If you give the @samp{--verbose} option, then @samp{tar --extract} will
print the names of the archive members as it extracts them.

@section How to Add Files to Existing Archives

If you want to add files to an existing archive, then don't use
@samp{tar --create}.  That will erase the archive and create a new one
in its place.  Instead, use @samp{tar --append}.  The command @samp{tar
--append --file=afiles.tar arbalest} would add the file @file{arbalest}
to the existing archive @file{afiles.tar}.  The archive must already
exist in order to use @samp{tar --append}.

As with @samp{tar --create}, the member names of the newly added files
will be the exact same as their names given on the command line.  The
@samp{--verbose} option will print out the names of the files as they
are written into the archive.

If you add a file to an archive using @samp{tar --append} with the
same name as an archive member already present in the archive, then the
old member is not deleted.  What does happen, however, is somewhat
complex.  @xref{Multiple Members with the Same Name}.  If you want to
replace an archive member, use @samp{tar --delete} first, and then use
@samp{tar --append}.

@section How to Delete Members from Archives

You can delete members from an archive using @samp{tar --delete}.
Specify the name of the archive with @samp{--file}.  List the member
names of the members to be deleted.  (If you list no member names, then
nothing will be deleted.)  The @samp{--verbose} option will cause
@code{tar} to print the names of the members as they are deleted.  As
with @samp{tar --extract}, it is important that you give the exact
member names when using @samp{tar --delete}.  Use @samp{tar --list} to
find out the exact member names in an archive (@pxref{Listing
Archives}).

The @samp{tar --delete} command only works with archives stored on disk.
You cannot delete members from an archive stored on a tape.

@section How to Archive Directories 

When the names of files or members specify directories, the operation of
@code{tar} is more complex.  Generally, when a directory is named,
@code{tar} also operates on all the contents of the directory,
recursively.  Thus, to @code{tar}, the file name @file{/} names the
entire file system.

To archive the entire contents of a directory, use @samp{tar --create}
(or @samp{tar --append}) as usual, and specify the name of the
directory.  For example, to archive all the contents of the current
directory, use @samp{tar --create --file=@var{archive-name} .}.  Doing
this will give the archive members names starting with @samp{./}.  To
archive the contents of a directory named @file{foodir}, use @samp{tar
--create --file=@var{archive-name} foodir}.  In this case, the member
names will all start with @samp{foodir/}.

If you give @code{tar} a command such as @samp{tar --create
--file=foo.tar .}, it will report @samp{tar: foo.tar is the archive; not
dumped}.  This happens because the archive @file{foo.tar} is created
before putting any files into it.  Then, when @code{tar} attempts to add
all the files in the directory @file{.} to the archive, it notices that
the file @file{foo.tar} is the same as the archive, and skips it.  (It
makes no sense to put an archive into itself.)  GNU @code{tar} will
continue in this case, and create the archive as normal, except for the
exclusion of that one file.  Other versions of @code{tar}, however, are
not so clever, and will enter an infinite loop when this happens, so you
should not depend on this behavior.  In general, make sure that the
archive is not inside a directory being dumped.

When extracting files, you can also name directory archive members on
the command line.  In this case, @code{tar} extracts all the archive
members whose names begin with the name of the directory.  As usual,
@code{tar} is not particularly clever about interpreting member names.
The command @samp{tar --extract --file=@var{archive-name} .} will not
extract all the contents of the archive, but only those members whose
member names begin with @samp{./}.

@section Shorthand Names

Most of the options to @code{tar} come in both long forms and short
forms.  The options described in this tutorial have the following
abbreviations (except @samp{--delete}, which has no shorthand form):

@table @samp
@item --create
@samp{-c}
@item --list
@samp{-t}
@item --extract
@samp{-x}
@item --append
@samp{-r}
@item --verbose
@samp{-v}
@item --file=@var{archive-name}
@samp{-f @var{archive-name}}
@end table

These options make typing long @code{tar} commands easier.  For example,
instead of typing
@example
tar --create --file=/tmp/afiles.tar --verbose apple angst asparagus
@end example
you can type
@example
tar -c -f /tmp/afiles.tar -v apple angst asparagus
@end example

For more information on option syntax, @ref{Invoking @code{tar}}.  In
the remainder of this manual, short forms and long forms are given
together when an option is discussed.

@chapter Invoking @code{tar}

The usual way to invoke tar is

@example
@code{tar} @var{options}... [@var{file-or-member-names}...]
@end example

All the options start with @samp{-}.  You can actually type in arguments
in any order, but in this manual the options always precede the other
arguments, to make examples easier to understand.

                                   for @code{tar} Commands
@end menu

@section The Forms of Arguments

Most options of @code{tar} have a single letter form (a single letter
preceded by @samp{-}), and at least one mnemonic form (a word or
abbreviation preceded by @samp{--}).  The forms are absolutely
identical in function.  For example, you can use either @samp{tar -t}
or @samp{tar --list} to list the contents of an archive.  In addition,
mnemonic names can be given unique abbreviations.  For example,
@samp{--cre} can be used in place of @samp{--create} because there is
no other option which begins with @samp{cre}.  

Some options require an additional argument.  Single letter options
which require arguments use the immediately following argument.
Mnemonic options are separated from their arguments by an @samp{=}
sign.  For example, to create an an archive file named
@file{george.tar}, use either @samp{tar --create --file=george.tar} or
@samp{tar --create -f george.tar}.  Both
@samp{--file=@var{archive-name}} and @samp{-f @var{archive-name}} denote
the option to give the archive a non-default name, which in the example
is @file{george.tar}.

You can mix single letter and mnemonic forms in the same command.  You
could type the above example as @samp{tar -c --file=george} or
@samp{tar --create -f george}.  However, @code{tar} operations and
options are case sensitive.  You would not type the above example as
@samp{tar -C --file=george}, because @samp{-C} is an option that
causes @code{tar} to change directories, not an operation that creates
an archive.  In fact, @samp{-C} requires a further argument (the name
of the directory which to change to).  In this case, tar would think
it needs to change to a directory named @samp{--file=george}, and
wouldn't interpret @samp{--file-george} as an option at all!

@section The Functions of Arguments

You must give exactly one option from the following list to tar.  This
option specifies the basic operation for @code{tar} to perform.

@table samp
@item --help
Print a summary of the options to @code{tar} and do nothing else

@item --create
@item -c
Create a new archive

@item --catenate
@item --concatenate
@item -A
Add the contents of one or more archives to another archive

@item --append
@item -a
Add files to an existing archive

@item --list
@item -t
List the members in an archive

@item --delete
Delete members from an archive

@item --extract
@item --get
@item -x
Extract members from an archive

@item --compare
@item --diff
@item -d
Compare members in an archive with files in the file system

@item --update
@item -u
Update an archive by appending newer versions of already stored files
@end itemize

The remaining options to @code{tar} change details of the operation,
such as archive format, archive name, or level of user interaction.
You can specify more than one option.

The remaining arguments are interpreted either as file names or as
member names, depending on the basic operation @code{tar} is
performing.  For @samp{--append} and @samp{--create} these arguments
specify the names of files (which must already exist) to place in the
archive.  For the remaining operation types, the additional arguments
specify archive members to compare, delete, extract, list, or update.
When naming archive members, you must give the exact name of the member
in the archive, as it is printed by @code{tar --list}.  When naming
files, the normal file name rules apply.

If you don't use any additional arguments, @samp{--append},
@samp{--catenate}, and @samp{--delete} will do nothing.  Naturally,
@samp{--create} will make an empty archive if given no files to add.
The other operations of @code{tar} (@samp{--list}, @samp{--extract},
@samp{--compare}, and @samp{--update}) will act on the entire contents
of the archive.

If you give the name of a directory as either a file name or a member
name, then @code{tar} acts recursively on all the files and directories
beneath that directory.  For example, the name @file{/} identifies all
the files in the filesystem to @code{tar}.

@section An Old, but Still Supported, Syntax for @code{tar} Commands

For historical reasons, GNU @code{tar} also accepts a syntax for
commands which splits options that require additional arguments into
two parts.  That syntax is of the form:

@example
@code{tar} @var{option-letters}... [@var{option-arguments}...] [@var{file-names}...]@refill
@end example

@noindent
where arguments to the options appear in the same order as the letters
to which they correspond, and the operation and all the option letters
appear as a single argument, without separating spaces.

This command syntax is useful because it lets you type the single
letter forms of the operation and options as a single argument to
@code{tar}, without writing preceding @samp{-}s or inserting spaces
between letters.  @samp{tar cv} or @samp{tar -cv} are equivalent to
@samp{tar -c -v}.

On the other hand, this old style syntax makes it difficult to match
option letters with their corresponding arguments, and is often
confusing.  In the command @samp{tar cvbf 20 /dev/rmt0}, for example,
@samp{20} is the argument for @samp{-b}, @samp{/dev/rmt0} is the
argument for @samp{-f}, and @samp{-v} does not have a corresponding
argument.  The modern syntax---@samp{tar -c -v -b 20 -f
/dev/rmt0}---is clearer.

@chapter Basic @code{tar} Operations

This chapter describes the basic operations supported by the @code{tar}
program.  A given invocation of @code{tar} will do exactly one of these
operations.

@section Creating a New Archive

The @samp{--create} (@code{-c}) option causes @code{tar} to create a new
archive.  The files to be archived are then named on the command line.
Each file will be added to the archive with a member name exactly the
same as the name given on the command line.  (When you give an absolute
file name @code{tar} actually modifies it slightly, @ref{Absolute
Paths}.)  If you list no files to be archived, then an empty archive is
created. 

If there are two many files to conveniently list on the command line,
you can list the names in a file, and @code{tar} will read that file.
@xref{Reading Names from a File}.

If you name a directory, then @code{tar} will archive not only the
directory, but all its contents, recursively.  For example, if you name
@file{/}, then @code{tar} will archive the entire filesystem.

Do not use the option to add files to an existing archive; it will
delete the archive and write a new one.  Use @samp{--append} instead.
(@xref{Adding to an Existing Archive}.)

There are various ways of causing @code{tar} to skip over some files,
and not archive them.  @xref{Specifying Names to @code{tar}}.

@section Adding to an Existing Archive

The @samp{--append} (@code{-r}) option will case @code{tar} to add new
files to an existing archive.  It interprets file names and member names
in exactly the same manner as @samp{--create}.  Nothing happens if you
don't list any names.

This option never deletes members.  If a new member is added under the
same name as an existing member, then both will be in the archive, with
the new member after the old one.  For information on how this affects
reading the archive, @ref{Multiple Members with the Same Name}.

This operation cannot be performed on some tape drives, unfortunately,
due to deficiencies in the formats thoes tape drives use.

@section Combining Archives

The @samp{--catenate} (or @code{--concatenate}, or @code{-A}) causes
@code{tar} to add the contents of several archives to an existing
archive.  

Name the archives to be catenated on the command line.  (Nothing happens
if you don't list any.)  The members, and their member names, will be
copied verbatim from those archives.  If this causes multiple members to
have the same name, it does not delete either; all the members with the
same name coexist.  For information on how this affects reading the
archive, @ref{Multiple Members with the Same Name}.

You must use this option to concatenate archives.  If you just combine
them with @code{cat}, the result will not be a valid @code{tar} format
archive.

This operation cannot be performed on some tape drives, unfortunately,
due to deficiencies in the formats thoes tape drives use.

@section Removing Archive Members

You can use the @samp{--delete} option to remove members from an
archive.  Name the members on the command line to be deleted.  This
option will rewrite the archive; because of this, it does not work on
tape drives.  If you list no members to be deleted, nothing happens.

@section Listing Archive Members

The @samp{--list} (@samp{-t}) option will list the names of members of
the archive.  Name the members to be listed on the command line (to
modify the way these names are interpreted, @pxref{Specifying Names to
@code{tar}}).  If you name no members, then @samp{--list} will list the
names of all the members of the archive.

To see more than just the names of the members, use the @samp{--verbose}
option to cause @code{tar} to print out a listing similar to that of
@samp{ls -l}.

@section Extracting Archive Members

Use @samp{--extract} (or @samp{--get}, or @samp{-x}) to extract members
from an archive.  For each member named (or for the entire archive if no
members are named) on the command line (or with @samp{--files-from}) the
a file is created with the contents of the archive member.  The name of
the file is the same as the member name.

The @samp{--same-permissions} (or @samp{--preserve-permissions}, or
@samp{-p}) options cause @code{tar} to cause the new file to have the
same permissions, owner, and so forth, as the original file did when it
was placed in the archive.  

The @samp{--mo


@chapter Specifying Names to @code{tar}

When specifying the names of files or members to @code{tar}, it by
default takes the names of the files from the command line.  There are
other ways, however, to specify file or member names, or to modify the
manner in which @code{tar} selects the files or members upon which to
operate.  In general, these methods work both for specifying the names
of files and archive members.

@section Reading Names from a File

Instead of giving the names of files or archive members on the command
line, you can put the names into a file, and then use the
@samp{--files-from=@var{file-name-list}} (@samp{-T
@var{file-name-list}}) option to @code{tar}.  Give the name of the file
which contains the list as the argument to @samp{--files-from}.  The
file names should be separated by newlines in the list.

If you want to specify names that might contain newlines, use the
@samp{--null} option.  Then, the filenames should be separated by NUL
characters (ASCII 000) instead of newlines.  In addition, the
@samp{--null} option turns off the @samp{-C} option (@pxref{Changing
Directory}).  

@section Excluding Some Files

The @samp{--exclude=@var{pattern}} option will prevent any file or
member which matches the regular expression @var{pattern} from being
operated on.  For example, if you want to create an archive with all the
contents of @file{/tmp} except the file @file{/tmp/foo}, you can use the
command @samp{tar --create --file=arch.tar --exclude=foo}.

If there are many files you want to exclude, you can use the
@samp{--exclude-from=@var{exclude-list}} (@samp{-X @var{exclude-list}})
option.  This works just like the
@samp{--files-from=@var{file-name-list}} option: specify the name of a
file as @var{exclude-list} which contains the list of patterns you want
to exclude.

@xref{Regular Expressions} for more information on the syntax and
meaning of regular expressions.

@section Operating Only on New Files

The @samp{--newer=@var{date}} (@samp{--after-date=@var{date}} or
@samp{-N @var{date}}) limits @code{tar} to only operating on files which
have been modified after the date specified.  (For more information on
how to specify a date, @xref{Date Formats}.)  A file is considered to
have changed if the contents have been modified, or if the owner,
permissions, and so forth, have been changed.  

If you only want @code{tar} make the date comparison on the basis of the
actual contents of the file's modification, then use the
@samp{--newer-mtime=@var{date}} option.

You should never use this option for making incremental dumps.  To learn
how to use @code{tar} to make backups, @ref{Making Backups}.

@section Crossing Filesystem Boundaries

The @samp{--one-file-system} option causes @code{tar} to modify its
normal behavior in archiving the contents of directories.  If a file in
a directory is not on the same filesystem as the directory itself
(because it is a mounted filesystem in its own right), then @code{tar}
will not archive that file, or (if it is a directory itself) anything
beneath it.  

This does not necessarily limit @code{tar} to only archiving the
contents of a single filesystem, because all files named on the command
line (or through the @samp{--files-from} option) will always be
archived.  

@chapter Changing the Names of Members when Archiing

@section Changing Directory

The @samp{--directory=@var{directory}} (@samp{-C @var{directory}})
option causes @code{tar} to change its current working directory to
@var{directory}.  Unlike most options, this one is processed at the
point it occurs within the list of files to be processed.  Consider the
following command:
@example
tar --create --file=foo.tar -C /etc passwd hosts -C /lib libc.a
@end example

This command will place the files @file{/etc/passwd}, @file{/etc/hosts},
and @file{/lib/libc.a} into the archive.  However, the names of the
archive members will be exactly what they were on the command line:
@file{passwd}, @file{hosts}, and @file{libc.a}.  The @samp{--directory}
option is frequently used to make the archive independent of the
original name of the directory holding the files.

Note that @samp{--directory} options are interpreted consecutively.  If
@samp{--directory} option specifies a relative pathname, it is
interpreted relative to the then current directory, which might not be
the same as the original current working directory of @code{tar}, due to
a previous @samp{--directory} option.

When using @samp{--files-from} (@pxref{Reading Names from a File}), you
can put @samp{-C} options in the file list.  Unfortunately, you cannot
put @samp{--directory} options in the file list.  (This interpretation
can be disabled by using the @samp{--null} option.)

@section Absolute Path Names

When @code{tar} extracts archive members from an archive, it strips any
leading slashes (@code{/}) from the member name.  This causes absolute
member names in the archive to be treated as relative file names.  This
allows you to have such members extracted wherever you want, instead of
being restricted to extracting the member in the exact directory named
in the archive.  For example, if the archive member has the name
@file{/etc/passwd}, @code{tar} will extract it as if the name were
really @file{etc/passwd}.

Other @code{tar} programs do not do this.  As a result, if you create an
archive whose member names start with a slash, they will be difficult
for other people with an inferior @code{tar} program to use.  Therefore,
GNU @code{tar} also strips leading slashes from member names when
putting members into the archive.  For example, if you ask @code{tar} to
add the file @file{/bin/ls} to an archive, it will do so, but the member
name will be @file{bin/ls}.

If you use the @samp{--absolute-paths} option, @code{tar} will do
neither of these transformations.

@section Symbolic Links

Normally, when @code{tar} archives a symbolic link, it writes a record
to the archive naming the target of the link.  In that way, the
@code{tar} archive is a faithful record of the filesystem contents.
However, if you want @code{tar} to actually dump the contents of the
target of the symbolic link, then use the @samp{--dereference} option.

transfer the archive to another, and extract the contents there. The basic
transfer medium might be magnetic tape, Internet FTP, or even electronic

@chapter The Structure of an Archive

While an archive may contain many files, the archive itself is a
single ordinary file.  Like any other file, an archive file can be
written to a storage device such as a tape or disk, sent through a
pipe or over a network, saved on the active file system, or even
stored in another archive.  An archive file is not easy to read or
manipulate without using the @code{tar} utility or Tar mode in Emacs.


Physically, an archive consists of a series of file entries terminated
by an end-of-archive entry, which consists of 512 zero bytes.  A file
entry usually describes one of the files in the archive (an
@dfn{archive member}), and consists of a file header and the contents
of the file.  File headers contain file names and statistics, checksum
information which @code{tar} uses to detect file corruption, and
information about file types. 

More than archive member can have the same file name.  One way this
situation can occur is if more than one version of a file has been
stored in the archive.  For information about adding new versions of a
file to an archive, @pxref{Modifying}.

In addition to entries describing archive members, an archive may contain
entries which @code{tar} itself uses to store information.
@xref{Archive Label}, for an example of such an archive entry.

Archives record not only an archive member's contents, but also its
file name or names, its access permissions, user and group, size in
bytes, and last modification time.  Some archives also record the file
names in each archived directory, as well as other file and directory
information.

Certain old versions of @code{tar} cannot handle additional
information recorded by newer @code{tar} programs.  To create an
archive which can be read by these old versions, specify the
@samp{--old-archive} option in conjunction with the @samp{tar --create}
operation.  When you specify this option, @code{tar} leaves out
information about directories, pipes, fifos, contiguous files, and
device files, and specifies file ownership by group and user ids
instead of names.

The @samp{--old-archive} option is needed only if the archive must be
readable by an older tape archive program which cannot handle the new format.
Most @code{tar} programs do not have this limitation, so this option
is seldom needed.

@cindex Labels on the archive media

@c !! Should the arg to --label be a quoted string??  no - ringo
To avoid problems caused by misplaced paper labels on the archive
media, you can include a @dfn{label} entry---an archive member which
contains the name of the archive---in the archive itself.  Use the
@samp{--label=@var{archive-label}} option in conjunction with the
@samp{--create} operation to include a label entry in the archive as it
is being created. 

If you create an archive using both @samp{--label=@var{archive-label}}
and @samp{--multi-volume}, each volume of the archive will have an
archive label of the form @samp{@var{archive-label} Volume @var{n}},
where @var{n} is 1 for the first volume, 2 for the next, and so on.
@xref{Multi-Volume Archives}, for information on creating multiple
volume archives.

If you extract an archive using @samp{--label=@var{archive-label}},
@code{tar} will print an error if the archive label doesn't match the
@var{archive-label} specified, and will then not extract the archive.
You can include a regular expression in @var{archive-label}, in this
case only.   
@c >>> why is a reg. exp. useful here?  (to limit extraction to a

To find out an archive's label entry (or to find out if an archive has
a label at all), use @samp{tar --list --verbose}.  @code{tar} will print the
label first, and then print archive member information, as in the

Format parameters specify how an archive is written on the archive

the type and number of files being archived, and on the media used to
store the archive.

To specify format parameters when accessing or creating an archive,
you can use the options described in the following sections.  If you
do not specify any format parameters, @code{tar} uses default
parameters.  You cannot modify a compressed archive.  If you create an
archive with the @samp{--block-size} option specified (@pxref{Blocking

archive.  @xref{Matching Format Parameters}, for other examples of

@subsection Archives Longer than One Tape or Disk
@cindex Multi-volume archives

To create an archive that is larger than will fit on a single unit of
the media, use the @samp{--multi-volume} option in conjunction with the
@samp{tar --create} operation (@pxref{Creating Archives}).  A
@dfn{multi-volume} archive can be manipulated like any other archive
(provided the @samp{--multi-volume} option is specified), but is stored
on more than one tape or disk.

When you specify @samp{--multi-volume}, @code{tar} does not report an
error when it comes to the end of an archive volume (when reading), or
the end of the media (when writing).  Instead, it prompts you to load
a new storage volume.  If the archive is on a magnetic tape, you
should change tapes when you see the prompt; if the archive is on a
floppy disk, you should change disks; etc.

You can read each individual volume of a multi-volume archive as if it
were an archive by itself.  For example, to list the contents of one
volume, use @samp{tar --list}, without @samp{--multi-volume} specified.
To extract an archive member from one volume (assuming it is described
that volume), use @samp{tar --extract}, again without
@samp{--multi-volume}.

If an archive member is split across volumes (ie. its entry begins on
one volume of the media and ends on another), you need to specify
@samp{--multi-volume} to extract it successfully.  In this case, you
should load the volume where the archive member starts, and use
@samp{tar --extract --multi-volume}---@code{tar} will prompt for later
volumes as it needs them.  @xref{Extracting From Archives} for more
information about extracting archives.

@samp{--info-script=@var{program-file}} is like @samp{--multi-volume},
except that @code{tar} does not prompt you directly to change media
volumes when a volume is full---instead, @code{tar} runs commands you
have stored in @var{program-file}.  This option can be used to
broadcast messages such as @samp{someone please come change my tape}
when performing unattended backups.  When @var{program-file} is done,
@code{tar} will assume that the media has been changed.

@subsection Archiving Sparse Files
@cindex Sparse Files

A file is sparse if it contains blocks of zeros whose existance is
recorded, but that have no space allocated on disk.  When you specify
the @samp{--sparse} option in conjunction with the @samp{--create}
operation, @code{tar} tests all files for sparseness while archiving.
If @code{tar} finds a file to be sparse, it uses a sparse
representation of the file in the archive.  @xref{Creating Archives},
for more information about creating archives.

@samp{--sparse} is useful when archiving files, such as dbm files,
likely to contain many nulls.  This option dramatically
decreases the amount of space needed to store such an archive.

@strong{Please Note:} Always use @samp{--sparse} when performing file

Even if your system has no no sparse files currently, some may be
created in the future.  If you use @samp{--sparse} while making file
system backups as a matter of course, you can be assured the archive
will always take no more space on the media than the files take on
disk (otherwise, archiving a disk filled with sparse files might take
hundreds of tapes).@refill

@subsection The Blocking Factor of an Archive
@cindex Blocking Factor
@cindex Block Size
@cindex Number of records per block
@cindex Number of bytes per block
@cindex Bytes per block
@cindex Records per block

The data in an archive is grouped into records, which are 512 bytes.
Records are read and written in whole number multiples called
@dfn{blocks}.  The number of records in a block (ie. the size of a
block in units of 512 bytes) is called the @dfn{blocking factor}.  The
@samp{--block-size=@var{number}} option specifies the blocking factor
of an archive.  The default blocking factor is typically 20 (ie.@:
10240 bytes), but can be specified at installation.  To find out the
blocking factor of an existing archive, use @samp {tar --list
--file=@var{archive-name}}.  This may not work on some devices. 

Blocks are seperated by gaps, which waste space on the archive media. 
If you are archiving on magnetic tape, using a larger blocking factor
(and therefore larger blocks) provides faster throughput and allows
you to fit more data on a tape (because there are fewer gaps). If you
are archiving on cartridge, a very large blocking factor (say 126 or
more) greatly increases performance. A
smaller blocking factor, on the other hand, may be usefull when
archiving small files, to avoid archiving lots of nulls as @code{tar}
fills out the archive to the end of the block. In general, the ideal block size
depends on the size of the inter-block gaps on the tape you are using,
and the average size of the files you are archiving.  @xref{Creating
Archives}, for information on writing archives.

Archives with blocking factors larger than 20 cannot be read by very
old versions of @code{tar}, or by some newer versions of @code{tar}
running on old machines with small address spaces.  With GNU
@code{tar}, the blocking factor of an archive is limited only by the
maximum block size of the device containing the archive, or by the
amount of available virtual memory.

If you use a non-default blocking factor when you create an archive,
you must specify the same blocking factor when you modify that
archive.  Some archive devices will also require you to specify the
blocking factor when reading that archive, however this is not
typically the case.  Usually, you can use @samp{tar --list} without
specifying a blocking factor---@code{tar} reports a non-default block
size and then lists the archive members as it would normally.  To
extract files from an archive with a non-standard blocking factor
(particularly if you're not sure what the blocking factor is), you can
usually use the {--read-full-blocks} option while specifying a blocking
factor larger then the blocking factor of the archive (ie. @samp{tar
--extract --read-full-blocks --block-size=300}.  @xref{Listing Contents}
for more information on the @samp{--list} operation.
@xref{read-full-blocks} for a more detailed explanation of that
option.

@subsection Creating and Reading Compressed Archives
@cindex Compressed archives
@cindex Storing archives in compressed format

@samp{--compress} indicates an archive stored in compressed format.
The @samp{--compress} option is useful in saving time over networks and
space in pipes, and when storage space is at a premium.
@samp{--compress} causes @code{tar} to compress when writing the
archive, or to uncompress when reading the archive.

To perform compression and uncompression on the archive, @code{tar}
runs the @code{compress} utility.  @code{tar} uses the default
compression parameters; if you need to override them, avoid the
@samp{--compress} option and run the @code{compress} utility
explicitly.  It is useful to be able to call the @code{compress}
utility from within @code{tar} because the @code{compress} utility by
itself cannot access remote tape drives.

The @samp{--compress} option will not work in conjunction with the
@samp{--multi-volume} option or the @samp{--add-file}, @samp{--update},
@samp{--add-file} and @samp{--delete} operations.  @xref{Modifying}, for
more information on these operations.

If there is no compress utility available, @code{tar} will report an
error.

@samp{--compress-block} is like @samp{--compress}, but when used in
conjunction with @samp{--create} also causes @code{tar} to pad the last
block of the archive out to the next block boundary as it is written.
This is useful with certain devices which require all write operations
be a multiple of a specific size.

@quotation
@strong{Please Note:} The @code{compress} program may be covered by a patent,

An archive can be saved as a file in the file system, sent through a
pipe or over a network, or written to an I/O device such as a tape or
disk drive.  To specify the name of the archive, use the
@samp{--file=@var{archive-name}} option.

An archive name can be the name of an ordinary file or the name of an
I/O device.  @code{tar} always needs an archive name---if you do not
specify an archive name, the archive name comes from the environment
variable @code{TAPE} or, if that variable is not specified, a default
archive name, which is usually the name of tape unit zero (ie.
/dev/tu00).

If you use @file{-} as an @var{archive-name}, @code{tar} reads the
archive from standard input (when listing or extracting files), or
writes it to standard output (when creating an archive).  If you use
@file{-} as an @var{archive-name} when modifying an archive,
@code{tar} reads the original archive from its standard input and

the archive, @code{tar} uses the value of the environment variable
@code{TAPE} as the file name for the archive, or, if that is not
available, @code{tar} uses a default archive name, usually that for tape
unit zero.  @xref{Archive Name}, for more information about specifying

The following example creates an archive named @file{stooges},
containing the files @file{larry}, @file{moe} and @file{curley}:

@example

If you specify a directory name as a file-name argument, @code{tar}

creates an archive named @file{hail/hail/fredonia}, containing the
contents of the directory @file{marx}:

@example
tar --create --file=hail/hail/fredonia marx

If you don't specify files to put in the archive, @code{tar} archives
all the files in the working directory.  The following example creates
an archive named @file{home} containing all the files in the working
directory:

@example
tar --create --file=home
@end example

@xref{File Name Lists}, for other ways to specify files to archive.

Note: In the example above, an archive containing all the files in the

@cindex Updating an archive

To add files to an archive, use @samp{tar --add-file}.  The archive to
be added to must already exist and be in proper archive format (which
normally means it was created previously using @code{tar}).  If the
archive was created with a different block size than now specified,
@code{tar} will report an error (@pxref{Blocking Factor}).  If the
archive is not a valid @code{tar} archive, the results will be
unpredictable.  You cannot add files to a compressed archive, however
you can add files to the last volume of a multi-volume archive.
@xref{Matching Format Parameters}.

The following example adds the file @file{shemp} to the archive
@file{stooges} created above:

@example
tar --add-file --file=stooges shemp
@end example

You must specify the files to be added; there is no default.

@samp{tar --update} acts like @samp{tar --add-file}, but does not add
files to the archive if there is already a file entry with that name
in the archive that has the same modification time.  

Both @samp{--update} and @samp{--add-file} work by adding to the end of
the archive.  When you extract a file from the archive, only the
version stored last will wind up in the file system.  Because
@samp{tar --extract} extracts files from an archive in sequence, and
overwrites files with the same name in the file system, if a file name

@subsection Appending One Archive's Contents to Another Archive
@cindex Adding archives to an archive

To append copies of an archive or archives to the end of another
archive, use @samp{tar --add-archive}.  The source and target archives
must already exist and have been created using compatable format
parameters (@pxref{Matching Format Parameters}).

@code{tar} will stop reading an archive if it encounters an
end-of-archive marker.  The @code{cat} utility does not remove
end-of-archive markers, and is therefore unsuitable for concatenating
archives.  @samp{tar --add-archive} removes the end-of-archive marker
from the target archive before each new archive is appended.
@c <<< xref ignore-zeros

You must specify the source archives using
@samp{--file=@var{archive-name}} (@pxref{Archive Name}).  If you do not
specify the target archive , @code{tar} uses the value of the
environment variable @code{TAPE}, or, if this has not been set, the
default archive name.

The following example adds the contents of the archive
@file{hail/hail/fredonia} to the archive @file{stooges} (both archives
were created in examples above):

@example
tar --add-archive --file=stooges hail/hail/fredonia
@end example

If you need to retrieve files from an archive that was added to using
the @code{cat} utility, use the @samp{--ignore-zeros} option

@subsection Matching the Format Parameters

Some format parameters must be taken into consideration when modifying
an archive:

Compressed archives cannot be modified.  

You have to specify the block size of the archive when modifying an
archive with a non-default block size.

Multi-volume archives can be modified like any other archive.  To add
files to a multi-volume archive, you need to only mount the last
volume of the archive media (and new volumes, if needed).  For all
other operations, you need to use the entire archive.  

If a multi-volume archive was labeled using @samp{--label}
(@pxref{Archive Label}) when it was created, @code{tar} will not
automatically label volumes which are added later.  To label
subsequent volumes, specify @samp{--label=@var{archive-label}} again in

@cindex Extraction
@cindex Retrieving files from an archive
@cindex Resurrecting files from an archive

To read archive members from the archive and write them into the file
system, use @samp{tar --extract}.  The archive itself is left
unchanged.

If you do not specify the files to extract, @code{tar} extracts all
the files in the archive.  If you specify the name of a directory as a
file-name argument, @code{tar} will extract all files which have been
stored as part of that directory.  If a file was stored with a
directory name as part of its file name, and that directory does not
exist under the working directory when the file is extracted,
@code{tar} will create the directory.  @xref{Selecting Archive
Members}, for information on specifying files to extract.

The following example shows the extraction of the archive
@file{stooges} into an empty directory:

@example
tar --extract --file=stooges
@end example

@noindent
Generating a listing of the directory (@samp{ls}) produces:

@example
larry
moe
shemp
marx
@end example

@noindent
The subdirectory @file{marx} contains the files @file{julius},
@file{alexander} and @file{karl}.

If you wanted to just extract the files in the subdirectory
@file{marx}, you could specify that directory as a file-name argument
in conjunction with the @samp{--extract} operation:

@example
tar --extract --file=stooges marx
@end example

@quotation
@strong{Warning:} Extraction can overwrite files in the file system.
To avoid losing files in the file system when extracting files from
the archive with the same name, use the @samp{--keep-old-files} option
(@pxref{File Writing Options}).

If the archive was created using @samp{--block-size}, @samp{--compress}

Normally, @code{tar} will request data in full block increments from
an archive storage device.  If the device cannot return a full block,
@code{tar} will report an error.  However, some devices do not always
return full blocks, or do not require the last block of an archive to
be padded out to the next block boundary.  To keep reading until you
obtain a full block, or to accept an incomplete block if it contains
an end-of-archive marker, specify the @samp{--read-full-blocks} option
in conjunction with the @samp{--extract} or @samp{--list} operations.
@xref{Listing Contents}.

The @samp{--read-full-blocks} option is turned on by default when
@code{tar} reads an archive from standard input, or from a remote
machine.  This is because on BSD Unix systems, attempting to read a
pipe returns however much happens to be in the pipe, even if it is
less than was requested.  If this option were not enabled, @code{tar}
would fail as soon as it read an incomplete block from the pipe.

If you're not sure of the blocking factor of an archive, you can read
the archive by specifying @samp{--read-full-blocks} and
@samp{--block-size=@var{n}}, where @var{n} is a blocking factor larger
than the blocking factor of the archive.  This lets you avoid having
to determine the blocking factor of an archive.  @xref{Blocking

@item -B 
Use in conjunction with @samp{tar --extract} to read an archive which

Normally @code{tar} stops reading when it encounters a block of zeros
between file entries (which usually indicates the end of the archive).
@samp{--ignore-zeros} allows @code{tar} to completely read an archive
which contains a block of zeros before the end (i.e.@: a damaged
archive, or one which was created by @code{cat}-ing several archives
together).

The @samp{--ignore-zeros} option is turned off by default because many
versions of @code{tar} write garbage after the end of archive entry,
since that part of the media is never supposed to be read.  GNU
@code{tar} does not write after the end of an archive, but seeks to
maintain compatablity among archiving utilities.

@table @samp
@item --ignore-zeros
@itemx -i
To ignore blocks of zeros (ie.@: end-of-archive entries) which may be

@end table

If you are using a machine with a small amount of memory, and you need
to process large list of file-names, you can reduce the amount of
space @code{tar} needs to process the list.  To do so, specify the
@samp{--same-order} option and provide an ordered list of file names.
This option tells @code{tar} that the @file{file-name} arguments
(provided on the command line, or read from a file using the
@samp{--files-from} option) are listed in the same order as the files
in the archive.

You can create a file containing an ordered list of files in the
archive by storing the output produced by @samp{tar --list

You can insure the accuracy of an archive by comparing files in the

operation, or can compare a previously written archive, to insure that

@samp{tar --create} operation.  When this option is specified,
@code{tar} checks archive members against their counterparts in the file

multi-volume archives, each volume is verified after it is written,
before the next volume is written.

To verify an archive, you must be able to read it from before the end

@samp{tar --compare} compares archive members in an existing archive
with their counterparts in the file system, and reports differences in
file size, mode, owner, modification date and contents.  If a file is
represented in the archive but does not exist in the file system,
@code{tar} reports a difference.

If you use @var{file-name} arguments in conjunction with @samp{tar
--compare}, @code{tar} compares the archived versions of the files
specified with their counterparts in the file system.  If you specify
a file that is not in the archive, @code{tar} will report an error.  If
you don't specify any files, @code{tar} compares all the files in the
archive.

Because @code{tar} only checks files in the archive against files in
the file system, and not vice versa, it ignores files in the file
system that do not exist in the archive.

The following example compares the archive members @file{larry},
@file{moe} and @file{curly} in the archive @file{stooges} with files
of the same name in the file system.

Typically, @code{tar} performs most operations without reporting any

encountered a problem when operating on an archive, however, you may
need more information than just an error message in order to solve the
problem.  The following options can be helpful diagnostic tools.

When used with most operations, @samp{--verbose} causes @code{tar} to
print the file names of the files or archive members it is operating
on.  When used with @samp{tar --list}, the verbose option causes
@code{tar} to print out an @samp{ls -l} type listing of the files in
the archive.

Verbose output appears on the standard output except when an archive
is being written to the standard output (as with @samp{tar --create
--file=- --verbose}).  In that case @code{tar} writes verbose output to
the standard error stream.

@table @samp
@item --verbose

To find out where in an archive a message was triggered, use
@samp{--record-number}.  @samp{--record-number} causes @code{tar} to

This option is especially useful when reading damaged archives, since
it helps pinpoint the damaged sections.  It can also be used with
@samp{tar --list} when listing a file-system backup tape, allowing you
to choose among several backup tapes when retrieving a file later, in

@section Asking for Confirmation During Operations
@cindex Interactive operation

Typically, @code{tar} carries out a command without stopping for
further instructions.  In some situations however, you
may want to exclude some files and archive members from the operation
(for instance if disk or storage space is tight).  You can do this by
excluding certain files automatically (@pxref{File Exclusion}), or by
performing an operation interactively, using the @samp{--interactive}
operation.  

When the @samp{--interactive} option is specified, @code{tar} asks for
confirmation before reading, writing, or deleting each file it
encounters while carrying out an operation.  To confirm the action you
must type a line of input beginning with @samp{y}.  If your input line
begins with anything other than @samp{y}, @code{tar} skips that file.

Commands which might be useful to perform interactively include
appending files to an archive, extracting files from an archive,
deleting a file from an archive, and deleting a file from disk during
an incremental restore.

If @code{tar} is reading the archive from the standard input,
@code{tar} opens the file @file{/dev/tty} to support the interactive

To @dfn{back up} a file system means to create archives that contain

@node Backup Levels, Backup Scripts, Backups and Restoration, Backups and Restoration
@section Levels of Backups

An archive containing all the files in the file system is called a
@dfn{full backup} or @dfn{full dump}.  You could insure your data by
creating a full dump every day.  This strategy, however, would waste a
substantial amount of archive media and user time, as unchanged files
are daily re-archived.

It is more efficient to do a full dump only occasionally.  To back up
files between full dumps, you can a incremental dump.  A @dfn{level
one} dump archives all the files that have changed since the last full
dump.

A typical dump strategy would be to perform a full dump once a week,
and a level one dump once a day.  This means some versions of files
will in fact be archived more than once, but this dump strategy makes
it possible to restore a file system to within one day of accuracy by
only extracting two archives---the last weekly (full) dump and the
last daily (level one) dump.  The only information lost would be in
files changed or created since the last daily backup.  (Doing dumps
more than once a day is usually not worth the trouble).

@node Backup Scripts, incremental and listed-incremental, Backup Levels, Backups and Restoration
@section Using Scripts to Perform Backups and Restoration

GNU @code{tar} comes with scripts you can use to do full and level-one
dumps.  Using scripts (shell programs) to perform backups and
restoration is a convenient and reliable alternative to typing out
file name lists and @code{tar} commands by hand.

Before you use these scripts, you need to edit the file
@file{backup-specs}, which specifies parameters used by the backup
scripts and by the restore script.  @xref{Script Syntax}.
Once the backup parameters are set, you can perform backups or
restoration by running the appropriate script.  

The name of the restore script is @code{restore}. The names of the
level one and full backup scripts are, respectively, @code{level-1} and
@code{level-0}.  The @code{level-0} script also exists under the name
@code{weekly}, and the @code{level-1} under the name
@code{daily}---these additional names can be changed according to your
backup schedule.  @xref{Scripted Restoration}, for more information
on running the restoration script.  @xref{Scripted Backups}, for more
information on running the backup scripts.

@emph{Please Note:} The backup scripts and the restoration scripts are
designed to be used together.  While it is possible to restore files
by hand from an archive which was created using a backup script, and
to create an archive by hand which could then be extracted using the
restore script, it is easier to use the scripts.  @xref{incremental

@item BACKUP_DIRS
A list of file systems to be dumped.  You can include any directory
name in the list---subdirectories on that file system will be

Subdirectories on other file systems will be ignored.

The host name specifies which host to run @code{tar} on, and should
normally be the host that actually contains the file system.  However,
the host machine must have GNU @code{tar} installed, and must be able
to access the directory containing the backup scripts and their
support files using the same file name that is used on the machine
where the scripts are run (ie. what @code{pwd} will print when in that

@file{backup-specs} is in shell script syntax.  The following
conventions should be considered when editing the script:
@c <<<   "conventions?"

A quoted string is considered to be contiguous, even if it is on more
than one line.  Therefore, you cannot include commented-out lines
within a multi-line quoted string.  BACKUP_FILES and BACKUP_DIRS are
the two most likely parameters to be multi-line.

A quoted string typically cannot contain wildcards.  In
@file{backup-specs}, however, the parameters BACKUP_DIRS and
BACKUP_FILES can contain wildcards.

@node Scripted Backups, Scripted Restoration, Backup Parameters, Backup Scripts
@subsection Using the Backup Scripts

The syntax for running a backup script is:

@example
@file{script-name} [@var{time-to-be-run}]
@end example

where @var{time-to-be-run} can be a specific system time, or can be
@kbd{now}.  If you do not specify a time, the script runs at the time
specified in @file{backup-specs} (@pxref{Script Syntax}).

You should start a script with a tape or disk mounted.  Once you start
a script, it prompts you for new tapes or disks as it needs them.
Media volumes don't have to correspond to archive files---a
multi-volume archive can be started in the middle of a tape that
already contains the end of another multi-volume archive.  The
@code{restore} script prompts for media by its archive volume, so to
avoid an error message you should keep track of which tape (or disk)
contains which volume of the archive.  @xref{Scripted Restoration}.

@c <<<have file names changed?  -ringo
The backup scripts write two files on the file system.  The first is a
record file in @file{/etc/tar-backup/}, which is used by the scripts
to store and retrieve information about which files were dumped.  This
file is not meant to be read by humans, and should not be deleted by
them.  @xref{incremental and listed-incremental}, for a more
detailed explanation of this file.

The second file is a log file containing the names of the file systems
and files dumped, what time the backup was made, and any error
messages that were generated, as well as how much space was left in
the media volume after the last volume of the archive was written.
You should check this log file after every backup.  The file name is
@file{log-@var{mmm-ddd-yyyy}-level-1} or
@file{log-@var{mmm-ddd-yyyy}-full}.

The script also prints the name of each system being dumped to the
standard output.

@node Scripted Restoration,  , Scripted Backups, Backup Scripts
@subsection Using the Restore Script
@c  subject to change as things develop

To restore files that were archived using a scripted backup, use the
@code{restore} script.  The syntax for the script is:


where ##### are the file systems to restore from, and
##### is a regular expression which specifies which files to
restore.  If you specify --all, the script restores all the files
in the file system.

You should start the restore script with the media containing the
first volume of the archive mounted.  The script will prompt for other
volumes as they are needed.  If the archive is on tape, you don't need
to rewind the tape to to its beginning---if the tape head is
positioned past the beginning of the archive, the script will rewind
the tape as needed.  @xref{Media}, for a discussion of tape
positioning.

If you specify @samp{--all} as the @var{files} argument, the
@code{restore} script extracts all the files in the archived file
system into the active file system.  

@quotation
@strong{Warning:}The script will delete files from the active file
system if they were not in the file system when the archive was made.

@node incremental and listed-incremental, Problems, Backup Scripts, Backups and Restoration
@section The @code{--incremental} and @code{--listed-incremental} Options

@samp{--incremental} is used in conjunction with @samp{--create},
@samp{--extract} or @samp{--list} when backing up and restoring file
systems.  An archive cannot be extracted or listed with the
@samp{--incremental} option specified unless it was created with the
option specified.  This option should only be used by a script, not by
the user, and is usually disregarded in favor of
@samp{--listed-incremental}, which is described below.

@samp{--incremental} in conjunction with @samp{--create} causes
@code{tar} to write, at the beginning of the archive, an entry for
each of the directories that will be archived.  The entry for a
directory includes a list of all the files in the directory at the
time the archive was created and a flag for each file indicating
whether or not the file is going to be put in the archive.
 
Note that this option causes @code{tar} to create a non-standard
archive that may not be readable by non-GNU versions of the @code{tar}
program.  

@samp{--incremental} in conjunction with @samp{--extract} causes
@code{tar} to read the lists of directory contents previously stored
in the archive, @emph{delete} files in the file system that did not
exist in their directories when the archive was created, and then
extract the files in the archive.

This behavior is convenient when restoring a damaged file system from
a succession of incremental backups: it restores the entire state of
the file system to that which obtained when the backup was made.  If
@samp{--incremental} isn't specified, the file system will probably
fill up with files that shouldn't exist any more.

@samp{--incremental} in conjunction with @samp{--list}, causes 
@code{tar} to print, for each directory in the archive, the list of
files in that directory at the time the archive was created.  This
information is put out in a format that is not easy for humans to
read, but which is unambiguous for a program: each file name is
preceded by either a @samp{Y} if the file is present in the archive,
an @samp{N} if the file is not included in the archive, or a @samp{D}
if the file is a directory (and is included in the archive).  Each
file name is terminated by a null character.  The last file is followed
by an additional null and a newline to indicate the end of the data.

@samp{--listed-incremental}=@var{file} acts like @samp{--incremental},
but when used in conjunction with @samp{--create} will also cause
@code{tar} to use the file @var{file}, which contains information
about the state of the file system at the time of the last backup, to
decide which files to include in the archive being created.  That file
will then be updated by @code{tar}.  If the file @var{file} does not
exist when this option is specified, @code{tar} will create it, and
include all appropriate files in the archive.

The file @var{file}, which is archive independent, contains the date
it was last modified and a list of devices, inode numbers and
directory names.  @code{tar} will archive files with newer mod dates
or inode change times, and directories with an unchanged inode number
and device but a changed directory name.  The file is updated after
the files to be archived are determined, but before the new archive is
actually created.

@chapter Tapes and Other Archive Media

Archives are usually written on dismountable media---tape cartridges,
mag tapes, or floppy disks.

The amount of data a tape or disk holds depends not only on its size,
but also on how it is formatted.  A 2400 foot long reel of mag tape
holds 40 megabytes of data when formated at 1600 bits per inch.  The
physically smaller EXABYTE tape cartridge holds 2.3 gigabytes.  

Magnetic media are re-usable---once the archive on a tape is no longer
needed, the archive can be erased and the tape or disk used over.
Media quality does deteriorate with use, however.  Most tapes or disks
should be disgarded when they begin to produce data errors.  EXABYTE
tape cartridges should be disgarded when they generate an @dfn{error
count} (number of non-usable bits) of more than 10k.

Magnetic media are written and erased using magnetic fields, and
should be protected from such fields to avoid damage to stored data.
Sticking a floppy disk to a filing cabinet using a magnet is probably
not a good idea.

@node Write Protection, Tape Positioning, Media, Media
@section Write Protection

All tapes and disks can be @dfn{write protected}, to protect data on
them from being changed.  Once an archive is written, you should write
protect the media to prevent the archive from being accidently
overwritten or deleted.  (This will protect the archive from being
changed with a tape or floppy drive---it will not protect it from
magnet fields or other physical hazards).

The write protection device itself is usually an integral part of the
physical media, and can be a two position (write enabled/write
disabled) switch, a notch which can be popped out or covered, a ring
which can be removed from the center of a tape reel, or some other
changeable feature.

@node Tape Positioning,  , Write Protection, Media
@section Tape Positions and Tape Marks

Just as archives can store more than one file from the file system,
tapes can store more than one archive file.  To keep track of where
archive files (or any other type of file stored on tape) begin and
end, tape archive devices write magnetic @dfn{tape marks} on the
archive media.  Tape drives write one tape mark between files,
two at the end of all the file entries.

If you think of data as a series of "0000"'s, and tape marks as "x"'s,
a tape might look like the following:

@example
0000x000000x00000x00x00000xx-------------------------
@end example

Tape devices read and write tapes using a read/write @dfn{tape
head}---a physical part of the device which can only access one point
on the tape at a time.  When you use @code{tar} to read or write
archive data from a tape device, the device will begin reading or
writing from wherever on the tape the tape head happens to be,
regardless of which archive or what part of the archive the tape head
is on.  Before writing an archive, you should make sure that no data
on the tape will be overwritten (unless it is no longer needed).
Before reading an archive, you should make sure the tape head is at
the beginning of the archive you want to read.  (The @code{restore}
script will find the archive automatically.  @xref{Scripted
Restoration}).  @xref{mt}, for an explanation of the tape moving
utility.

If you want to add new archive file entries to a tape, you should
advance the tape to the end of the existing file entries, backspace
over the last tape mark, and write the new archive file.  If you were
to add two archives to the example above, the tape might look like the
following:

@example
0000x000000x00000x00x00000x000x0000xx----------------

@subsection The @code{mt} Utility

<<< is it true that this only works on non-block devices?  should
<<< explain the difference, xref to block-size (fixed or variable).

You can use the @code{mt} utility to advance or rewind a tape past a
specified number of archive files on the tape.  This will allow you to
move to the beginning of an archive before extracting or reading it,
or to the end of all the archives before writing a new one.
@c why isn't there an "advance 'til you find two tape marks together"? 

The syntax of the @code{mt} command is:

@example
mt [-f @var{tapename}] @var{operation} [@var{number}]
@end example

where @var{tapename} is the name of the tape device, @var{number} is
the number of times an operation is performed (with a default of one),
and @var{operation} is one of the following:

@table @code
@item eof
@itemx weof
Writes @var{number} tape marks at the current position on the tape.


@item fsf  
Moves tape position forward @var{number} files.


@item bsf

@item status

@end table
<<< is there a better way to frob the spacing on the list?  -ringo

@appendix Details of the Archive Data Format

This chapter is based heavily on John Gilmore's @i{tar}(5) manual page
for the public domain @code{tar} that GNU @code{tar} is based on.
@c it's been majorly edited since, we may be able to lose this.

The archive media contains a series of records, each of which contains
512 bytes.  Each archive member is represented by a header record,
which describes the file, followed by zero or more records which
represent the contents of the file.  At the end of the archive file
there may be a record consisting of a series of binary zeros, as an
end-of-archive marker.  GNU @code{tar} writes a record of zeros at the
end of an archive, but does not assume that such a record exists when
reading an archive.

Records may be grouped into @dfn{blocks} for I/O operations.  A block
of records is written with a single @code{write()} operation.  The
number of records in a block is specified using the @samp{--block-size}
option.  @xref{Blocking Factor}, for more information about specifying
block size.

All characters in headers are 8-bit characters in the local variant of
ASCII.  Each field in the header is contiguous; that is, there is no
padding in the header format. 

Data representing the contents of files is not translated in any way
and is not constrained to represent characters in any character set.
@code{tar} does not distinguish between text files and binary files.

The @code{name}, @code{linkname}, @code{magic}, @code{uname}, and
@code{gname} fields contain null-terminated character strings.  All
other fields contain zero-filled octal numbers in ASCII.  Each numeric
field of width @var{w} contains @var{w} @minus{} 2 digits, a space, and a
null, except @code{size} and @code{mtime}, which do not contain the
trailing null.

@node Header Fields, Sparse File Handling, Header Data, Data Format Details
@appendixsec The Meaning of Header Fields

The @code{name} field contains the name of the file.
<<< how big a name before field overflows? 

The @code{mode} field contains nine bits which specify file
permissions, and three bits which specify the Set UID, Set GID, and
Save Text (``stick'') modes.  Values for these bits are defined above.
@xref{File Writing Options}, for information on how file permissions
and modes are used by @code{tar}.

The @code{uid} and @code{gid} fields contain the numeric user and
group IDs of the file owners.  If the operating system does not
support numeric user or group IDs, these fields should be ignored.
@c but are they?

The @code{size} field contains the size of the file in bytes; this
field contains a zero if the header describes a link to a file.

The @code{mtime} field contains the modification time of the file.
This is the ASCII representation of the octal value of the last time
the file was modified, represented as an integer number of seconds
since January 1, 1970, 00:00 Coordinated Universal Time.
@xref{File Writing Options}, for a description of how @code{tar} uses
this information.

The @code{chksum} field contains the ASCII representation of the octal
value of the simple sum of all bytes in the header record.  To
generate this sum, each 8-bit byte in the header is added to an
unsigned integer, which has been initialized to zero.  The precision
of the integer is seventeen bits.  When calculating the checksum, the
@code{chksum} field itself is treated as blank.

The @code{atime} and @code{ctime} fields are used when making
incremental backups; they store, respectively, the file's access time
and last inode-change time.

The value in the @code{offset} field is used when making a
multi-volume archive.  The offset is number of bytes into the file
that we need to go to pick up where we left off in the previous
volume, i.e the location that a continued file is continued from.

The @code{longnames} field supports a feature that is not yet
implemented.  This field should be empty.

The @code{magic} field indicates that this archive was output in the
P1003 archive format.  If this field contains @code{TMAGIC}, the
@code{uname} and @code{gname} fields will contain the ASCII
representation of the owner and group of the file respectively.  If
found, the user and group IDs are used rather than the values in the
@code{uid} and @code{gid} fields.

The @code{sp} field is used to archive sparse files efficiently.
@xref{Sparse File Handling}, for a description of this field, and
other fields it may imply.

The @code{typeflag} field specifies the file's type.  If a particular
implementation does not recognize or permit the specified type,
@code{tar} extracts the file as if it were a regular file, and reports
the discrepancy on the standard error.  @xref{File Types}.  @xref{GNU
File Types}.

@appendixsubsec File Types

The following flags are used to describe file types:

@table @code
@item LF_NORMAL
@itemx LF_OLDNORMAL
Indicates a regular file.  In order to be compatible with older
versions of @code{tar}, a @code{typeflag} value of @code{LF_OLDNORMAL}
should be silently recognized as a regular file.  New archives should
be created using @code{LF_NORMAL} for regular files.  For backward
compatibility, @code{tar} treats a regular file whose name ends with a
slash as a directory.

@item LF_LINK
Indicates a link to another file, of any type, which has been
previously archived.  @code{tar} identifies linked files in Unix by
matching device and inode numbers.  The linked-to name is specified in
the @code{linkname} field with a trailing null.

@item LF_SYMLINK
Indicates a symbolic link to another file.  The linked-to
name is specified in the @code{linkname} field with a trailing null.  
@xref{File Writing Options}, for information on archiving files
referenced by a symbolic link.

@item LF_CHR
@itemx LF_BLK
Indicate character special files and block special files,
respectively.  In this case the @code{devmajor} and @code{devminor}
fields will contain the major and minor device numbers.  Operating
systems may map the device specifications to their own local
specification, or may ignore the entry.

@item LF_DIR
Indicates a directory or sub-directory.  The directory name in the
@code{name} field should end with a slash.  On systems where disk
allocation is performed on a directory basis, the @code{size} field
will contain the maximum number of bytes (which may be rounded to the
nearest disk block allocation unit) that the directory can hold.  A
@code{size} field of zero indicates no size limitations.  Systems that
do not support size limiting in this manner should ignore the
@code{size} field.

@item LF_FIFO
Indicates a FIFO special file.  Note that archiving a FIFO file
archives the existence of the file and not its contents.

@item LF_CONTIG
Indicates a contiguous file.  Contiguous files are the same as normal
files except that, in operating systems that support it, all the
files' disk space is allocated contiguously.  Operating systems which
do not allow contiguous allocation should silently treat this type as
a normal file.

@item 'A' @dots{}
@itemx 'Z'
These are reserved for custom implementations.  Some of these are used
in the GNU modified format, which is described below.  @xref{GNU File
Types}.  
@end table

Certain other flag values are reserved for specification in future
revisions of the P1003 standard, and should not be used by any
@code{tar} program.

@node GNU File Types,  , File Types, Header Fields
@appendixsubsec Additional File Types Supported by GNU

GNU @code{tar} uses additional file types to describe new types of
files in an archive.  These are listed below.

@table @code
@item LF_DUMPDIR
@itemx 'D'
Indicates a directory and a list of files created by the
@samp{--incremental} option.  The @code{size} field gives the total
size of the associated list of files.  Each file name is preceded by
either a @code{'Y'} (the file should be in this archive) or an
@code{'N'} (the file is a directory, or is not stored in the archive).
Each file name is terminated by a null.  There is an additional null
after the last file name.

@item LF_MULTIVOL
@itemx 'M'
Indicates a file continued from another volume of a multi-volume
archive (@pxref{Multi-Volume Archives}).  The original type of the file is not
given here.  The @code{size} field gives the maximum size of this
piece of the file (assuming the volume does not end before the file is
written out).  The @code{offset} field gives the offset from the
beginning of the file where this part of the file begins.  Thus
@code{size} plus @code{offset} should equal the original size of the
file.

@item LF_SPARSE
@itemx 'S' 
Indicates a sparse file.  @xref{Sparse Files}.  @xref{Sparse File
Handling}.

@item LF_VOLHDR
@itemx 'V'
Marks an archive label that was created using the @samp{--label} option
when the archive was created (@pxref{Archive Label}.  The @code{name}
field contains the argument to the option.  The @code{size} field is
zero.  Only the first file in each volume of an archive should have
this type.
@end table

@node Sparse File Handling,  , Header Fields, Data Format Details
@appendixsec Fields to Handle Sparse Files

The following header information was added to deal with sparse files
(@pxref{Sparse Files}):

@c  TALK TO MIB
The @code{sp} field (fields? something else?) is an array of
@code{struct sparse}.  Each @code{struct sparse} contains two
12-character strings, which represent the offset into the file and the
number of bytes to be written at that offset.  The offset is absolute,
and not relative to the offset in preceding array elements.

The header can contain four of these @code{struct sparse}; if more are
needed, they are not stored in the header, instead, the flag
@code{isextended} is set and the next record is an
@code{extended_header}.
@c @code{extended_header} or @dfn{extended_header} ???  the next
@c record after the header, or in the middle of it.

The @code{isextended} flag is only set for sparse files, and then only
if extended header records are needed when archiving the file.

Each extended header record can contain an array of 21 sparse
structures, as well as another @code{isextended} flag.  There is no
limit (except that implied by the archive media) on the number of
extended header records that can be used to describe a sparse file.

@c so is @code{extended_header} the right way to write this?
