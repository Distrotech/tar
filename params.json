{"name":"Tar","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/tar.git","body":"README for GNU tar\r\nSee the end of file for copying conditions.\r\n\r\n* Introduction\r\n\r\nPlease glance through *all* sections of this\r\n'README' file before starting configuration.  Also make sure you read files\r\n'ABOUT-NLS' and 'INSTALL' if you are not familiar with them already.\r\n\r\nIf you got the 'tar' distribution in 'shar' format, time stamps ought to be\r\nproperly restored; do not ignore such complaints at 'unshar' time.\r\n\r\nGNU 'tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk\r\narchive, and can restore individual files from the archive.  It includes\r\nmultivolume support, the ability to archive sparse files, automatic archive\r\ncompression/decompression, remote archives and special features that allow\r\n'tar' to be used for incremental and full backups.  This distribution\r\nalso includes 'rmt', the remote tape server.  The 'mt' tape drive control\r\nprogram is in the GNU 'cpio' distribution.\r\n\r\nGNU 'tar' is derived from John Gilmore's public domain 'tar'.\r\n\r\nSee file 'ABOUT-NLS' for how to customize this program to your language.\r\nSee file 'COPYING' for copying conditions.\r\nSee file 'INSTALL' for compilation and installation instructions.\r\nSee file 'PORTS' for various ports of GNU tar to non-Unix systems.\r\nSee file 'NEWS' for a list of major changes in the current release.\r\nSee file 'THANKS' for a list of contributors.\r\n\r\nBesides those configure options documented in files 'INSTALL' and\r\n'ABOUT-NLS', an extra option may be accepted after './configure':\r\n\r\n* Install\r\n\r\n** Selecting the default archive format.\r\n\r\nThe default archive format is GNU, this can be overridden by\r\npresetting DEFAULT_ARCHIVE_FORMAT while configuring. The allowed\r\nvalues are GNU, V7, OLDGNU, USTAR and POSIX.\r\n\r\n** Selecting the default archive device\r\n\r\nThe default archive device is now 'stdin' on read and 'stdout' on write.\r\nThe installer can still override this by presetting 'DEFAULT_ARCHIVE'\r\nin the environment before configuring (the behavior of '-[0-7]' or\r\n'-[0-7]lmh' options in 'tar' are then derived automatically).  Similarly,\r\n'DEFAULT_BLOCKING' can be preset to something else than 20.\r\n\r\n** Selecting full pathname of the \"rmt\" binary.\r\n\r\nPrevious versions of tar always looked for \"rmt\" binary in the\r\ndirectory \"/etc/rmt\". However, the \"rmt\" program included\r\nin the distribution was installed under \"$prefix/libexec/rmt\".\r\nTo fix this discrepancy, tar now looks for \"$prefix/libexec/rmt\".\r\nIf you do not want this behavior, specify full path name of\r\n\"rmt\" binary using DEFAULT_RMT_DIR variable, e.g.:\r\n\r\n./configure DEFAULT_RMT_DIR=/etc\r\n\r\nIf you already have a copy of \"rmt\" installed and wish to use it\r\ninstead of the version supplied with the distribution, use --with-rmt\r\noption:\r\n\r\n./configure --with-rmt=/etc/rmt\r\n\r\nThis will also disable building the included version of rmt.\r\n\r\n** Installing backup scripts.\r\n\r\nThis version of tar is shipped with the shell scripts for producing\r\nincremental backups (dumps) and restoring filesystems from them.\r\nThe name of the backup script is \"backup\". The name of the\r\nrestore script is \"restore\". They are installed in \"$prefix/sbin\"\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\nUse option --enable-backup-scripts to compile and install these\r\nscripts.\r\n\r\n** '--disable-largefile' omits support for large files, even if the\r\noperating system supports large files.  Typically, large files are\r\nthose larger than 2 GB on a 32-bit host.\r\n\r\n* Installation hints\r\n\r\nHere are a few hints which might help installing 'tar' on some systems.\r\n\r\n** gzip and bzip2.\r\n\r\nGNU tar uses the gzip and bzip2 programs to read and write compressed\r\narchives.  If you don't have these programs already, you need to\r\ninstall them.  Their sources can be found at:\r\n\r\nftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/\r\nhttp://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2/\r\n\r\nIf you see the following symptoms:\r\n\r\n   $ tar -xzf file.tar.gz\r\n   gzip: stdin: decompression OK, trailing garbage ignored\r\n   tar: Child returned status 2\r\n\r\nthen you have encountered a gzip incompatibility that should be fixed\r\nin gzip test version 1.3, which as of this writing is available at\r\n<ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/>.  You can work around the\r\nincompatibility by using a shell command like\r\n 'gzip -d <file.tar.gz | tar -xzf -'.\r\n\r\n** Solaris issues.\r\n\r\nGNU tar exercises many features that can cause problems with older GCC\r\nversions.  In particular, GCC 2.8.1 (sparc, -O1 or -O2) is known to\r\nmiscompile GNU tar.  No compiler-related problems have been reported\r\nwhen using GCC 2.95.2 or later.\r\n\r\nRecent versions of Solaris tar sport a new -E option to generate\r\nextended headers in an undocumented format.  GNU tar does not\r\nunderstand these headers.\r\n\r\n** Static linking.\r\n\r\nSome platform will, by default, prepare a smaller 'tar' executable\r\nwhich depends on shared libraries.  Since GNU 'tar' may be used for\r\nsystem-level backups and disaster recovery, installers might prefer to\r\nforce static linking, making a bigger 'tar' executable maybe, but able to\r\nwork standalone, in situations where shared libraries are not available.\r\nThe way to achieve static linking varies between systems.  Set LDFLAGS\r\nto a value from the table below, before configuration (see 'INSTALL').\r\n\r\n\tPlatform\tCompiler\tLDFLAGS\r\n\r\n\t(any)\t\tGnu C\t\t-static\r\n\tAIX\t\t(vendor)\t-bnso -bI:/lib/syscalls.exp\r\n\tHPUX\t\t(vendor)\t-Wl,-a,archive\r\n\tIRIX\t\t(vendor)\t-non_shared\r\n\tOSF\t\t(vendor)\t-non_shared\r\n\tSCO 3.2v5\t(vendor)\t-dn\r\n\tSolaris\t\t(vendor)\t-Bstatic\r\n\tSunOS\t\t(vendor)\t-Bstatic\r\n\r\n** Failed tests 'ignfail.sh' or 'incremen.sh'.\r\n\r\nIn an NFS environment, lack of synchronization between machine clocks\r\nmight create difficulties to any tool comparing dates and file time stamps,\r\nlike 'tar' in incremental dumps.  This has been a recurrent problem with\r\nGNU Make for the last few years.  We would like a general solution.\r\n\r\n** BSD compatibility matters.\r\n\r\nSet LIBS to '-lbsd' before configuration (see 'INSTALL') if the linker\r\ncomplains about 'bsd_ioctl' (Slackware).  Also set CPPFLAGS to\r\n'-I/usr/include/bsd' if <sgtty.h> is not found (Slackware).\r\n\r\n** OPENStep 4.2 swap files\r\n\r\nTar cannot read the file /private/vm/swapfile.front (even as root).\r\nThis file is not a real file, but some kind of uncompressed view of\r\nthe real compressed swap file; there is no reason to back it up, so\r\nthe simplest workaround is to avoid tarring this file.\r\n\r\n* Special topics\r\n\r\nHere are a few special matters about GNU 'tar', not related to build\r\nmatters.  See previous section for such.\r\n\r\n** File attributes.\r\n\r\nAbout *security*, it is probable that future releases of 'tar' will have\r\nsome behavior changed.  There are many pending suggestions to choose from.\r\nToday, extracting an archive not being 'root', 'tar' will restore suid/sgid\r\nbits on files but owned by the extracting user.  'root' automatically gets\r\na lot of special privileges, '-p' might later become required to get them.\r\n\r\nGNU 'tar' does not properly restore symlink attributes.  Various systems\r\nimplement flavors of symbolic links showing different behavior and\r\nproperties.  We did not successfully sorted all these out yet.  Currently,\r\nthe 'lchown' call will be used if available, but that's all.\r\n\r\n** POSIX compliance.\r\n\r\nGNU 'tar' is able to create archive in the following formats:\r\n\r\n  *** The format of UNIX version 7\r\n  *** POSIX.1-1988 format, also known as \"ustar format\"\r\n  *** POSIX.1-2001 format, also known as \"pax format\"\r\n  *** Old GNU format (described below)\r\n\r\nIn addition to those, GNU 'tar' is also able to read archives\r\nproduced by 'star' archiver.\r\n\r\nA so called 'Old GNU' format is based on an early draft of the\r\nPOSIX 1003.1 'ustar' standard which is different from the final\r\nstandard. It defines its extensions (such as incremental backups\r\nand handling of the long file names) in a way incompatible with\r\nany existing tar archive format, therefore the use of old GNU\r\nformat is strongly discouraged.\r\n\r\nPlease read the file NEWS for more information about POSIX compliance\r\nand new 'tar' features.\r\n\r\n* What's next?\r\n\r\nGNU tar will be merged into GNU paxutils: a project containing\r\nseveral utilities related to creating and handling archives in\r\nvarious formats. The project will include tar, cpio and pax\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\n* Bug reporting.\r\n\r\nSend bug reports to <bug-tar@gnu.org>.  A bug report should contain\r\nan adequate description of the problem, your input, what you expected,\r\nwhat you got, and why this is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but they only\r\ndescribe a solution, from which the problem might be uneasy to infer.\r\nIf needed, submit actual data files with your report.  Small data files\r\nare preferred.  Big files may sometimes be necessary, but do not send them\r\nto the report address; rather take special arrangement with the maintainer.\r\n\r\nYour feedback will help us to make a better and more portable package.\r\nConsider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If you\r\ndevelop anything pertaining to 'tar' or have suggestions, let us know\r\nand share your findings by writing to <bug-tar@gnu.org>.\r\n\r\n\f\r\n* Copying\r\n\r\nCopyright 1990-1992, 1994, 1997-2001, 2003-2004, 2007, 2012-2013 Free\r\nSoftware Foundation, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis file is part of GNU tar.\r\n\r\nGNU tar is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nGNU tar is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
